        5.1.1 variables ✅
        5.1.2 vectors ✅
        5.1.3 structs 

    5.2 Implement the self keyword 

4. Functions by reference ❌
    4.1 Functions by reference in functions -> only id 
        4.1.1 variables 
        4.1.2 vectors
        4.1.3 structs





-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Set primitive values 
1.1. Create the interaces for the primitive values ✅
    Int 
    Float
    String
    Boolean
    Character
    Nil
1.2. Create methods to determine and set the primitive values ✅

2. Id expression
    If an IdExpr is found, check if it is a variable or a function
    Variable -> check if it is declared, and return the value

3. Variable Declaration with type and expression or not ✅
    1. Evaluate if the variable is already declared 
    2. Evaluate if the variable is "var" or "let" 
        a. If it is "var" -> the variable can have an expression or not 
        b. If it is "let" -> the variable must have an expression if not, throw an error 
    3. Evaluate if the variable has a type or not 
    4. Evaluate if the variable has an expression or not 

4. Variable Assigment ✅
    1. Evaluate if the variable is declared 
    2. Evaluate if the variable is "var" or "let"
        a. If it is "var" -> the variable can change its value
        b. If it is "let" -> the variable cannot change its value
    3. Evaluate if the new value is the same type as the variable
        a. If it is the same type -> change the value
        b. If it is not the same type -> throw an error

5. Assign operations ✅
    5.1 += , -=
        1. Evaluate if the variable is declared
        2. Evaluate if the variable is "var" or "let"
            a. If it is "var" -> the variable can change its value
            b. If it is "let" -> the variable cannot change its value
        3. Evaluate if the new value is the same type as the variable
            a. If it is the same type -> change the value -> variable = variable + expression
            b. If it is not the same type -> throw an error

6. Comparation operations ✅
7. Relational operations ✅
8. Logical operations ✅

Cntrol Sentences
--------------------------------
1. If statement ✅ -> pending work with continue and return
2. Switch statement ✅ -> break done
3. While statement ✅ -> pending work with break, continue and return
4. For statement ✅ -> pending work with arrays
5. Guard statement ✅ -> pending work with break, continue and return [add error if any transfer sentence is found]
