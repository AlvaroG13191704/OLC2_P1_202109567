    Variable -> check if it is declared, and return the value

3. Variable Declaration with type and expression or not

    3. Evaluate if the variable has a type or not ✅
    4. Evaluate if the variable has an expression or not ✅

4. Variable Assigment
    1. Evaluate if the variable is declared 
    2. Evaluate if the variable is "var" or "let"
        a. If it is "var" -> the variable can change its value
        b. If it is "let" -> the variable cannot change its value
    3. Evaluate if the new value is the same type as the variable
        a. If it is the same type -> change the value
        b. If it is not the same type -> throw an error
